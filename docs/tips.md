- Traversing order:
  - DFS
- WATCHING for traversing algorithm, look for visited nodes

- Shortcut is not evaluated !! What about this?

- WASM Stack operation needs numeric type matchs: for example f32.add expects [f32, f32] on the stack
- Bitwise or boolean operators only in integer types

- Validate stack

- Type inferring from runtime information:
  - Take always the most representative type
  - Generating large random name for registry variable name in instrumentation execution


- TODOS:
  - Implement Browser sandbox

- Profilers
  - NodeJS
  - Browser profilers
