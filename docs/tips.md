- Traversing order:
  - DFS
- WATCHING for traversing algorithm, look for visited nodes

- Shortcut is not evaluated !! What about this?
- What about objects evaluated as boolean cast?

- WASM Stack operation needs numeric type matchs: for example f32.add expects [f32, f32] on the stack
- Bitwise or boolean operators only in integer types

- Validate stack

- Type inferring from runtime information:
  - Take always the most representative type
  - Generating large random name for registry variable name in instrumentation execution


- Two strategies:
    - One and one only expression mutation
    - More than one expression mutation

    - Is there a difference between parent translations and its children?
    - Is there a difference between wrapper function names?

- Profilers
  - NodeJS (TODO)
  - Browser profilers (DONE)
